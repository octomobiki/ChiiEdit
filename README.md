## Installation
To install locally into ~/usr/local/bin:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will place ChiiEdit in ~/usr/local/bin. You can then add it to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="${PATH}":/home/"${USER}"/usr/local/bin
```

To install the manual autotools way:

```bash
autoreconf -iv
./configure
make
make install
```

## Usage
ChiiEdit can be executed by itself to start creating a file from scratch.

To modify a file, or create a new one, simply pass it a filename:

```bash
ChiiEdit foo.txt
```
