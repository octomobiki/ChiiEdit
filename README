# ChiiEdit

ChiiEdit is a basic text editor written in C without relying on any libraries.

## Installation

To install locally into ~/usr/local/bin:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will place ChiiEdit in ~/usr/local/bin. You can then add it to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="${PATH}":/home/"${USER}"/usr/local/bin
```

To install the manual autotools way:

```bash
autoreconf -iv
./configure
make
make install
```

## Usage

ChiiEdit can be executed by itself to start creating a file from scratch.
To modify a file, simply pass it a file you'd like to modify:

```bash
ChiiEdit foo.txt
```
